# NeuroSystem

This project explores brain‚Äìcomputer interfacing (BCI) using a 6-channel EEG setup with an ESP32. The system streams EEG signals over Wi-Fi, visualizes them in real time, and applies machine learning to predict the color a user is thinking of.

üîë Key Features

ESP32-based EEG Acquisition

Reads 6 EEG channels (ADC pins 32‚Äì39).

Serves raw EEG values as JSON via /eeg endpoint.

Live visualization in the browser using Chart.js.

Real-Time EEG Graphs

Web dashboard (/graph) shows all 6 channels updating live.

Useful for monitoring signal quality and electrode placement.

Color Prediction via ML
Two modes of operation:

SSVEP Mode (Recommended):

Colored tiles flicker at unique frequencies (8‚Äì20 Hz).

The user stares at a color ‚Üí brain‚Äôs visual cortex locks to that frequency.

FFT analysis detects the frequency ‚Üí maps to the intended color.

Imagined Color Mode (Experimental):

User imagines a color without visual stimulus.

Bandpower features are extracted from EEG signals.

Trained LDA/SVM model predicts the intended color.

Python ML Backend

Flask server fetches EEG from ESP32.

Performs FFT-based frequency decoding (SSVEP) or feature extraction + classifier prediction (Imagined).

Exposes /predict_ssvep and /predict_imagined endpoints for real-time results.

Frontend Interfaces

EEG Graph UI ‚Üí live signal chart.

SSVEP Stimulus UI ‚Üí flickering colored tiles for attention-based selection.

Prediction UI ‚Üí displays the detected color with confidence level.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Hardware: ESP32, BioAmp / EEG frontend, 6-channel electrode setup.

Firmware: C++ (Arduino), Wi-Fi WebServer for streaming data.

Backend: Python (Flask, NumPy, Scikit-Learn).

Frontend: HTML, Chart.js, Vanilla JS.

üöÄ How It Works

ESP32 collects EEG ‚Üí streams raw ADC values via Wi-Fi.

Python backend subscribes to EEG stream and buffers signals.

Signal Processing & ML

SSVEP: FFT finds the strongest frequency component ‚Üí maps to color.

Imagined: Bandpower features extracted ‚Üí passed to trained classifier.

Web UI shows prediction ‚Üí background color updates in real time.

üìä Example Demo

Live EEG graph from 6 channels.

Flickering colored tiles ‚Üí user stares at one ‚Üí predicted color updates.

Optional: train custom models for imagined color classification.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is a prototype research/demo project, not a medical device. EEG is very sensitive to noise and requires proper electrode placement and signal conditioning.
